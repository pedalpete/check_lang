All files needed to use the language checker are included, the only gem required is for rspec to run the tests. 

1. How to try it
	open a terminal
	go to the diretory where check_lang was unpacked
	type 'ruby index.rb'
	I have included test files in the test_files folder, for example to try french type test_folder/test_f.txt

The only languages currently included in the package are french, german, spanish and english. More can easily be added by selecting some text in the appropriate language, saving it to a file, and using the convert.rb to clean up the new language. Then name the language appropriately so it can be identified properly.
